## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional E-commerce website bookestore is a responsive e-commerce website. The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. There are a few important modules in the project like home page, image carousel, book Registration page, my_booke page, Available books page etc. The data is accessed using ajax call and then rendered into the webpage using dynamic html template created using string literals. For Available books-page we are using localstorage to temporarily storing data before clicking on the checkout button. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant feature pages.
